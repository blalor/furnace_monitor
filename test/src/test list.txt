clock is 8mhz

zone monitor (voltage sense) --
    when there is a voltage differential, nothing is calling for heat
        LED is lit, so MID400 will output LOW
    when no voltage differential, will (possibly us) is calling for heat
        LED is NOT lit, so MID400 should output HIGH

current sense --
    when current is flowing, there is a voltage differential
        LED is lit, so MID400 will output LOW
        we are calling for heat, furnace is running
    when current is NOT flowing, there is no voltage differential
        LED is NOT lit, so MID400 will output HIGH
        if we are calling for heat
            furnace is NOT running (low water/high temp cutoff)

test:
    X relay activate (PB4)
    X detect current (PB3)
    X detect zone state (PB2)
      send samples every 15 seconds
      start timer
      cancel timer
      transmit serial data
      receive serial data
